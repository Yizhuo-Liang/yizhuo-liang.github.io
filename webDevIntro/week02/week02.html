            It feels amazing to read someone's imagination of the future from more than
            a century ago. Actually most of the predictions of the technology already
            took place in reality. Even the most convolutedly sophisticated logical and
            emotional thinking of human can be conducted by artifitial intelligence, which
            is impossible for the ones who live in 19th century to imagine. Sadly, the 
            first problem indicated in the article is not resolved yet: people didn't 
            really augment our own minds or our ways to understand and store informations.
            As the author says, it took a huge amount of time for scientists just to know
            what others found out from the academic papers. Now, collaboration between
            scientists is still base on academic papers. While the complexity of siences
            boomed when it gets more and more advanced and it's impossibble for a single
            man to study something, scientists still waste lots of time on understanding
            others papers. More generally, unlike the imagination of the author, human
            didn't create a real "second brain" in the last 150 years. The softwres who
            claim themselves "second brain" are still note taking softwares.

        <h2> Long Live The Web by Tim Berners-Lee </h2>

        <p style = "background-color: rgb(256, 256, 256)">
            This article, which was wrote 11 years ago, successfully predicted the issues
            of the internet. Sadly, the warnings of Mr.Berners-Lee didn't work out, where
            nowadays the web world still have problems of information freedom, privacy
            violation, government supervision abuse, etc... But, I believe people are still
            working on fixing those problems. Probably we have to wait longer, wait for 
            web3 which is decentrialized rather than centralized web2.
